# **Sci-Fi-Zone**

## **About**

Full Stack Frameworks Milestone Project for Code Institute's Diploma in Software Development

Sci-Fi-Zone offers various tickets for a fictional science-fiction themed convention. Users browsing the site can see which actors will attend the convention, when and where the convention will take place, and which type of tickets are available. Users can put the various tickets into their shopping bag, edit the contents of their shopping bag, create a profile to save their address data and access their order history, and buy the tickets through secure checkout.

4. Select the **Deploy** tab and choose **Github** as **Deployment method**.
5. Select the **Settings** tab and click on **Reveal Config Vars** in the section **Config Vars**. Enter your key-value-pairs from your **env.py** file without the quotes. The following variables should be added:
    - !!!!ADD VARIABLES!!!!!
    - DEBUG: False
        - Set this value to 'True' when updating the code.
        - **In any other case set it to 'False' to avoid remote code execution!**
